 An app for front end dev application.

 It will be further developed in another repo to support grades 7 & 8 in the new 2022 Ontario Science Curriculum.

 As a former special educator starting a new career in information technology, I'd like to support teachers and students by developing a quick and easy to access lesson plan and activities on artifical intelligence. The future app will have a choice of themes including one that is low vision and dyslexia friendly. There will also be functionality to monitor and/or restrict students from asking inappropriate questions (because they will try).
