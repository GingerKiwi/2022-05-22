    <p class="fs-500 ff-serif d-block instructions">With the new Ontario Science curriculum starting this September (2022), 
        there is an immediate need for teaching and learning reasources that support the new strand 
    <a href="https://www.dcp.edu.gov.on.ca/en/curriculum/science-technology/context/strands#strand-a" class="text-accent">"Strand A - STEM Skills and Connections".</a> 

    <p class="fs-500 ff-serif d-block instructions"> For grades 7 and 8, this new strand includes specific expectations to: <br>
    <span class="quote">"A2.2: identify and describe impacts of coding and of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence systems, on everyday life, including skilled trades"</span> </p>

    <p class="fs-500 ff-serif d-block instructions">As a former special educator starting a new career in information technology, 
        I'd like to support teachers and students by developing a quick and easy to access lesson plan and activities on artifical intelligence. 
        The future app will have a choice of themes including one that is low vision and dyslexia friendly. 
        There will also be functionality to monitor and/or restrict students from asking inappropriate questions (because they will try).
    </p>
    <p class="fs-500 ff-serif d-block instructions">   
        Developing an app that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 artifical intelligence is an application requirement for the 2022 Shopify Front End Development internship.
        Whether or not I'm successful, I'd like this part of my application to help others besides for just myself. (Besides, grade 7 & 8 students are so awesome!) <br>
        Look for the lesson plan and activities later this summer on my website: https://www.gingerkiwi.dev
